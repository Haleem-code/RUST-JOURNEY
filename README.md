# Rust Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Rust journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn and build projects with Rust and Solana. 

## Structure 📂
- `rust-journey/` - Contains all Rust projects and experiments.
  - `hello-world/` - My first Rust project: a simple "Hello, World!" program.
  - More folders to come as I progress!

## Why Rust? 🤔
I'm diving into Rust to build performant and secure blockchain applications, primarily on Solana. My goal is to master Rust fundamentals while applying them to real-world projects.

## Setup 🛠️
To run the projects, navigate to the desired folder and execute:
```bash
cargo run
