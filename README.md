# Rust Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Rust journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn and build projects with Rust and Solana. 

## Structure 📂
- `rust-journey/` - Contains all Rust projects and experiments.
  - `hello-world/` - My first Rust project: a simple "Hello, World!" program.
  - `primitive_data_types` - Learnt about the primitive data types in rust:Integers(i and u) , float(f32 and f64), boolean(ture or false) then character(char for unicode scalr value that is for letters)
  - `basic-programming-concept`-learnt functions and alsotuples gave me hard time but i get it now
  - More folders to come as I progress!

## Why Rust? 🤔
I'm diving into Rust to build backend Applications, performant and secure blockchain applications, primarily on Solana. My goal is to master Rust fundamentals while applying them to real-world projects.

## Setup 🛠️
To run the projects, navigate to the desired folder and execute:
```bash
cargo run
```
or
```bash 
rustc src/main
```
then
```bash
 ./main
